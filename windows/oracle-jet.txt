Installing and creating your first Oracle JET app is as simple as 1-2-3

    npm install -g @oracle/ojet-cli

-> above did not work on windows7, already had node installed via chocolaty package manager. hence used:

npm install -g oracle/ojet-cli

    ojet create ojet-demo --template=navdrawer
    cd ojet-demo
    ojet serve
